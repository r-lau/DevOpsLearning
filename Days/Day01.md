## What is DevOps?

DevOps is not software, not a system, not a tool, and not something bought. 

Rather, DevOps is a culture that works on doing things smarter. It's a combination of Software Development and Operations. Its aim is to reduce the time between the start of software developement to release. 

One of the core functions of the DevOps Engineer is to break down the silos between different engineering groups such as Developers, Operations, and QA.

At a high-level, the primarily thought process for a DevOps engineer is to figure out what can be automated to be more effective and efficient.

The DevOps sign is an infinite symbol since it represents a continuous process of improving efficency. This cycle is in the order of Plan > Code > Build > Test > Deploy > Operate > Monitor.
