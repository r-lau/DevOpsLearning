## Agile Methodlogy

There are two metholodgies in Software Development, waterfall and agile.

Today will be focused on Agile Metholodgy

Agile aims to deliver updates in small increments rather than having a big launch. The goal is to have an optimal user experience.

Projects in the agile metholodgy get broken down in several dynamic phases known as sprints.

## There are four pillars of Agile:

- Individuals over processes and tools: Valuing team collboration and teamwork over independence

- Working software over comprehensive documentation: Software developed should work, documentation isn't as imporatnt as developing good software

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: Customers should guide where the software should go

- Responding to change over following a plan: Allowing the team to be flexible so strategies and workflows can shift without derailing the project.

## Agile Metholodgies

Kanban is a visual approach to Agile. Tasks are represented by cards on a board and stages are represented in columns. Cards get moved along the board as they're worked on to indicate what stage the task is in.

Scrum is led by a scrum master whose job is to clear all blockers.
The meetings discuss sprint planning and retrospective or review.

## Terms
Team - Agile applies to software developers and project managers. DevOps Engineers are considered part of the Agile team because they are involved in all stages of the product cycle and lie in the intersection of development, QA, and operations.

Applied Frameworks - Agile contains many management frameworks to achieve flexibility and transparency.

User Stories - Team divides up the work to be done into increments called "user stories"

Daily Meeting - Same time everyday, the team meets to bring up any blockers

Team - In Agile, it means a small group of people assigned to the same project
